influxd-restore(1)
==================

NAME
----
influxd-restore - Restores the metastore, databases, retention policies, or specific shards.  Legacy mode requires
the instance to be stopped before running, and will wipe all databases from the system (e.g., for disaster recovery).
The improved online mode requires the instance to be running, and the database name used must not already exist.

SYNOPSIS
--------
'influxd restore' [-legacy] [flags] PATH

DESCRIPTION
-----------
Uses backups from the PATH to restore the metastore, databases, retention policies, or specific shards. The InfluxDB process must not be running during a restore.
